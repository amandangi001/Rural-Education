            Education is important for everybody, whether they are learning new facts, skills, or trades. Having the opportunity to learn always benefits the individual. Over the past years, we have seen a focus on providing education to females all over the world, arguing that girls receive an education no less then men. However, if we take a step further, we can think about educating communities, specifically rural communities. What effects would education have if we were to educate a group of people?<br><br>
            It is important to understand the need for good quality education in rural areas, as it helps keep rural areas populated. Young people move to urban areas for better opportunities in education and employment, improved rural education is one possible strategy for keeping them in rural areas. It was recently documented that 69% of India’s population lives in rural areas. Quality education is a pertinent tool for enhancing quality of life, creating awareness and capability, increasing freedom, and improving overall holistic human development for the people and the nation.<br>

            Quality formal education has become an inseparable part of human progress in the modern world. It has become imperative for an individual to be ‘educated’ in true spirit of the word by moving beyond the conventional frameworks of learning.
